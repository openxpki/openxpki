response:
    # The scep standard is a bit unclear if the root should be in the chain
    # or not. We consider it a security risk (trust should be always set
    # by hand) but as most clients seem to expect it, we include the root
    # by default.
    # The getca response contains the certificate of the SCEP server itself
    # and of the current active issuer (which can but need not to be the same!)
    # You can define weather to have only the certificate itself (endentity),
    # the chain without the root (chain)  or the chain including the root
    # (fullchain).
    # Note: The response is cached internally in the datapool so changes
    # will not show up immediately - to list the cached items use
