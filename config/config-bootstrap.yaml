# This file is a sample to bootstrap the config tree from an, optionally
# signed, config blob instead of having a file based tree.

# Check the documentation for details
# http://openxpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/configuration/introduction.html

bootstrap:
    # this is the only mandatory option
    LOCATION: /home/pkiadm/config.oxi

    # This is the default and should be left empty unless overridden
    # class: OpenXPKI::Config::Loader

    # if you want to use signed configs, set ONE of the ca* options
    # Path holding the certificates as files (filemame = hash)
    # ca_certificate_path: /etc/openxpki/ca/config.certs/
    # All certificates in one file
    # ca_certificate_file: /etc/openxpki/ca/config.pem

    # temp dir, required to create files to perform signature verification
    # tmpdir: /tmp

    # path to openssl
    # openssl: /usr/bin/openssl
