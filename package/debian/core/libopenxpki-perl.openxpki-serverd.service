# We want systemd to give the daemon some time to finish gracefully, but still want
# it to kill httpd after TimeoutStopSec if something went wrong during the
# graceful stop. Normally, Systemd sends SIGTERM signal right after the
# ExecStop, which would kill the daemon. We are sending useless SIGCONT here to give
# the daemon time to finish.
