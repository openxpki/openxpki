The tests here are intended to be used for QA on a running system, which may
be a test, integration or production instance. 

Currently, there are two categories of tests:

    backend/    tests the backend components by accessing them directly
                via command line or API

    selenium/   Uses the Selenium web application testing system (available
                at http://seleniumhq.org) to run tests via the user interface.

Destructive vs. non-destructive tests:

Many of the tests rely on
specific system data (e.g.: user names and smartcard token serial numbers) that
will vary from system to system. For the full tests, an LDIF file is supplied
that contains the sample data for the openxpki reference test installation. By
starting the destructive tests, the existing records (only the DNs found in the
LDIF) are deleted and re-inserted. This is necessary because a few of the tests
actually modify data in the LDAP directory. Of course, for production systems,
these tests are skipped.

Customizing:

The configuration is read in using Config::Std and the individual tests (should)
follow the following path priorities when loading the configuration. The default
configuration is located in the same directory as the test script itself:
$GITBASE/trunk/qatest/<category>/<subset>/. Additionally, a system-specific 
configuration file, kept in the config repository, is found in the directory:
$GITBASE/config/qatest/<category>/<subset>/, where $GITBASE/config is a symlink to the
working config repository.
