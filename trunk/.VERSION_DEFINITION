# Tag list.
#
# List of tags for which a git description should be computed and stored.
# the keys of this section are interpreted as git tag names (shell glob
# style wildcards are ok) and queried via 'git describe --tags --match TAG'.
# If a value is defined, it will be used as the mapped name of the tag, 
# otherwise the key name is used as a default.
# The result of this command is available as an internal component via
# 'git-description-MAPPING'.
#
[GIT_REFERENCE_TAGS]
# We expect a tag on the root commit called 'inital' to allow vergen to
# compute the number of commits that happened from that one to the tip of
# the branch. See below (git-revision).
initial: root


# Custom configuration.
#
# Sections that start with an underscore are ignored by vergen. While
# this is usually not very useful, you might wish to take advantage
# of this when using a perl expression in your custom components.
# As an example we use this feature to specify the filter branch name for
# use in our custom component git-filtered-branch (see below).

# Version number components

# built-in components (component names are 'magic'), but you can modify 
# the keyword(s).
# Currently the following magic built-ins are defined:
# 'revision'
#     the global SVN revision number
# 'last-changed-revision'
#     obtains the highest "Last Changed Rev" below the current 
#     directory (recursively)
# The following keywords are only expanded if Git is used:
# 'git-commit-hash'
#     commit hash
# 'git-abbreviated-commit-hash'
#     abbreviated commit hash (hint: git-show-ref -h -s --abbrev HEAD)
# 'git-tag'
#     tag name of the current checkout (empty string if no tag is defined,
#     if more than one tags are set for the current head then only the first
#     tag is reported)
# 'git-tags'
#     identical to git-tag; if more than one tag is set for the current
#     checkout all tags are listed (comma separated)
# 'git-description'
#     result of git describe --tags
# 'git-description-XXXX'
#     see above (GIT_REFRENCE_TAGS section)

# Custom components
# To create a custom version number component define the following keys:
# filename:         File name to use. vergen searches upwards from  the
#                   current directory until it finds the specified file.
#                   The file contents will be assigned as the component
#                   value.
# expression:       Perl expression to evaluate when expanding the keyword.
#                   Mutually exclusive with filename.
# keyword:          Symbolic name(s) describing the version component that 
#                   can be used to reference its value.
#                   More than one keyword can be used for aliasing the 
#                   component. Only the first keyword defined is used 
#                   for --dump, though.
# optional:         If set to 'yes' or 'true', this component is not mandatory

#[git-revision]
# the following expression returns the number of git commits between the 
# tag 'initial' (which is expected to exist on the root commit of the 
# repository) and the current head. if executed on a clean git-svn branch 
# this returns one less that the subversion revision number (hence we increment
# the returned number to compensate).
# note that this only works on a clean git-svn branch, it will report a
# different commit count on forked branches, dependin on what happened
# on this branch. if you use this number (e. g. in a package build) it is
# highly recommended to also include the branch name to indicate on which
# branch this number was computed.

[git-filtered-branch]
# The following expression returns the 'filtered' current git branch name. 
# if the branch name matches the value configured in section _CUSTOM_CONFIG,
# key 'branch_filter' the value is empty, otherwise the current 
# branch name is returned. Special characters that might cause problem
# in file names are replaced by underscore characters.
# This keyword is intended to be used in package descriptions, describing
# the "flavour" of the package. The idea is to define a default branch
# (e. g. master) which is replaced with the empty string. When building
# a package from this branch the resulting package name is the base name.
# When building from a different branch, the filtered branch name could
# be part of the package description, helping people to distinguish
# the customized package from an upstream one.
