OpenXPKI-Client-SCEP version 0.0.1

[ REPLACE THIS...

  The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
  how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
  example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
  that should be understood before the module is installed.

  A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
  README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
  archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
  good idea to provide version information here so that people can
  decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.
