Welcome to the OpenXPKI documentation.

Reading the documentation online
================================

The ReadTheDocs site

http://openxpki.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

always contains the latest documentation of the upstream project.


Reading the documentation offline
=================================

In order to build the documentation (either for offline reading or for
contributing) please install Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) and run

make html

in order to build the documentation.


Contributing
============

If you wish to contribute documentation please fork the OpenXPKI project
(https://github.com/openxpki/openxpki) on Github.

Checkout the branch you wish to write documentation for (typically either
master or develop) and branch off a feature branch locally:

git checkout develop
git branch feature/documentation

Read the Sphinx documentation (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/index.html) before
contributing.
Once you are done, push your work to your Github repository and raise a
Pull Request via the Github infrastructure.
