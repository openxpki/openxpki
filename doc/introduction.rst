Introduction
============

This manual describes the installation and use of the OpenXPKI software, an Open Source trustcenter solution written by The OpenXPKI Project.

The intended audience are CA administrators and operators. We assume that readers are familiar working on a Unix shell and have enough background knowledge about Public Key Infrastructures to understand the relevant terms.

The OpenXPKI manual is split into the following sections:

* The introduction, which you are reading right now. Following this abstract, you will learn more about where to get the software, where to get help. Furthermore, a high-level overview of the system design and some key concepts will be presented.
* The :ref:`quickstart` lays the emphasis on getting a minimal Certificate Authority (CA) without any bells and whistles running. Reference to further configuration options is provided inline, so that you know where to look if you want to configure more advanced features. Please note that setting up a working CA is a complex task and thus the ''quick'' in "quick start" may be a bit euphemistic.
* The :ref:`setup` chapter gives a more detailed introduction with brief configuration examples to adjust the system to your needs based on the existing, pre-defined workflows and code.
* In the :ref:`operation` chapter we describe commands and tools which are required for setting up the non-config items (e.g., the crypto tokens) and to perform daily operation.
* If you need to extend the system, read the :ref:`developer` section to learn how to use the workflow engine and the connector layer to make the system fit your needs.

Key features

Assuming this is your first contact with OpenXPKI here is a quick summary of what it is and what it is capable of.

OpenXPKI aims to be an enterprise-scale Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) solution, supporting well established infrastructure components like RDBMS and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). It started as the successor of OpenCA,
and builds on the experience gained while developing it as well as on our experience in large public key infrastructures.

* *CA rollover:* "Normal" trust center software usually does not account for the installment of a new CA certificate, thus if the CA certificate becomes invalid, a complete re-deployment has to be undertaken. OpenXPKI solves this problem by automatically deciding which CA certificate to use at a certain point in time.
* *Support for multiple so-called PKI realms:* Different CA instances can be run in a single installation without any interaction between them, so one machine can be used for different CAs.
* *Private key support both in hardware and software:* OpenXPKI has support for professional Hardware Security Modules such as the nCipher nShield or the Safenet Luna CA modules. If such modules are not available, access to a key can be protected by using a threshold secret sharing algorithm.
* *Professional database support:* The user can choose from a range of database backends, including commercial ones such as Oracle which are typically used in enterprise scenarios.
* *Many different interfaces to the server:* Humans can access the CA server using a web-interface. Embedded devices such as routers can also use the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) to talk to the server and apply for certificates - including automatic renewal. If integration into existing systems is required, REST and SOAP interfaces are also available.
* *Workflow Engine:* OpenXPKI aims to be extremely customizable by allowing the definition of workflows for any process you can think of in the PKI area. Typical workflows such as editing and approving certificate signing requests, certificate and CRL issuance are already implemented. Implementing your own idea is normally pretty easy by defining a workflow in a YAML configuration file and (maybe) implementing a few lines in Perl.
* *I18N:* Localization of the application and interfaces is easily possible.
* *Template-based certificate details:* Contrary to the typical CA system, your users do not need to know about how you would like the subject to look like - you can just ask them for the information they know (for example a hostname and port) and OpenXPKI will create the corresponding subject and subjectAlternativeNames for you. Regular expression support allows you to enforce certificate naming conventions easily.
* *Interchangeble notifation backends* We can of course send eMail notifications to customers and operators but if you have a heavy load of certificate requests that need additional communication with the requesters, you can easily attach ticket system like, which will receive updates on the certificate status.
