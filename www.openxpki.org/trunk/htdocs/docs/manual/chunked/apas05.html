under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the
Modified Version:</p><div class="orderedlist"><a name="gfdl-modif-cond"></a><p class="title"><b>GNU FDL Modification Conditions</b></p><ol type="A"><li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a
  title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
  versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
  section of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous
  version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</li><li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more
  persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
  the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
  authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer
  than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
</li><li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of
  the Modified Version, as the publisher.</li><li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
</li><li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
  modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
</li><li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
  license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
  Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
  <a href="apas12.html" title="ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents">Addendum</a> below.
</li><li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of
  Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
  license notice.</li><li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.
</li><li>Preserve the section Entitled &#8220;<span class="quote">History</span>&#8221;, Preserve its
  Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
  authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
  Page.  If there is no section Entitled &#8220;<span class="quote">History</span>&#8221; in the Document,
  create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
  Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
  Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
</li><li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
  Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
  likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
  versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the &#8220;<span class="quote">History</span>&#8221;
  section.  You may omit a network location for a work that was
  published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the
  original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
</li><li>For any section Entitled &#8220;<span class="quote">Acknowledgements</span>&#8221; or
  &#8220;<span class="quote">Dedications</span>&#8221;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
  section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
  acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
</li><li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
  unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
  equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
</li><li>Delete any section Entitled &#8220;<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>&#8221;.
  Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
</li><li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
  &#8220;<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>&#8221; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</li><li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol></div><p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p><p>You may add a section Entitled &#8220;<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>&#8221;, provided it
contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.</p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may
not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission
from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="apas04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="apa.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="apas06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">COPYING IN QUANTITY </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> COMBINING DOCUMENTS</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
