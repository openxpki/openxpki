<h2>About OpenXPKI</h2>
<p>
  The OpenXPKI Project aims at creating an enterprise-grade
  PKI/Trustcenter software supporting well established infrastructure 
  components like RDBMS and Hardware Security Modules. Flexibility and
  modularity are the project's key design objectives.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike many other OpenSource PKI projects OpenXPKI offers
  <a href="<& /lib/url.mas,
	 path => '/features/index.html' &>">powerful features</a>
  necessary for professional environments that are usually
  only found in commercial grade PKI products. (If you have ever wondered
  what could be done to provide <b>continuous operation</b> of a PKI without
  having to struggle with the system every time your CA certificate expires,
  OpenXPKI is probably the right thing for you.)
</p>
<p>
  However, we also target small scale installations by providing 
  quick-start configuration examples that allow to get a usable PKI 
  running quickly.
</p>
<p>
  OpenXPKI runs on most Unix-like operating system (verified on 
  FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris/OpenSolaris and Mac OS X).<br/>
  Database backends exist for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and DB2.<br>
  OpenXPKI also integrates with the 
  <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/">RT Request Tracker</a> and
  supports nCipher's nShield Hardware Security Modules.

<dt>Architecture White Paper available</dt>
<dd>The OpenXPKI Team has compiled a White Paper on the architecture 
  and key features of the OpenXPKI software. The paper is 
  <a href="docs/OpenXPKI-Architecture-Overview.pdf">available 
    as a PDF Document here</a> and outlines the architecture of the
  system. Development follows the concepts described there closely.

<h2>News</h2>
<p>Currently there is no stable release of OpenXPKI yet, but as of November
  2008 the code is basically feature-complete. We are currently preparing
  the 1.0 release which is mostly a documentation issue.
</p>
<p>
  There are, however, already existing production deployments for OpenXPKI,
  the oldest one known to us has been in production since February 2007 
  without any major problems.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  OpenXPKI originally started as a fork of OpenCA in October 2005 driven 
  by the former OpenCA developers, but quickly turned out to be a complete
  redesign and rewite.
