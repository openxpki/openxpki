The webui is a client centric application that uses ajax to retrieve structured
data from the server and renders the pages using the Ember.js framework with the
handlebars templating system. The code is written in coffee script using the 
bungle compiler framework. This directory contains the developer code of the UI, 
this MUST NOT go onto your webserver.

Customization
=============

For moderate UI customization you can create your own index.html file based on 
the themed.html sample file. You can customize header and footer section inside
or add custom css to it. 

Modification
============

To make major modifications, you can edit the source code and recompile it 
afterwards. Use the "bungle" compiler, which is available using the Node.js
package manager npm and run "bungle build" inside this directory. This will
copy all requried files into the dist/ directory.

Warning: bungle 0.1.0 currently has a bug which shreds binary files. Please
copy the fonts and images manually over to the dist after rebuild. 

Uglification
############

To get plain code for debugging, set pipes.jscompressor.type = "passthrough" 
in bungle.json (line 195)
