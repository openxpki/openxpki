=head1 NAME

OpenXPKI::Workflow::Handler - Workflow factory manager

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Handler class that manages the workflow factories for the different realms
and configuration states. The class is created on server init and stored
in the context as workflow_handler. It always creates one factory using the
workflow definitions from the current head version for each realm. You can
specify additional instances that should be created to the constructor.

This is a shortcut method that expects only a workflow id and will take care
of finding the correct version and workflow type and returns an instance of
OpenXPKI::Workflow.

    # We have now obtained the configuration id that was active during
    # creation of the workflow instance. However, if for some reason
    # the matching configuration is not available we have two options:
    # 1. bail out with an error
    # 2. accept that there is an error and continue anyway with a different
    #    configuration
    # Option 1 is not ideal: if the corresponding configuration has for
    # some reason be deleted from the database the workflow cannot be
    # instantiated any longer. This is often not really a problem but
    # sometimes this will lead to severe problems, e. g. for long
    # running workflows. unfortunately, if a workflow cannot be instantiated
    # it can neither be displayed, nor executed.
    # In order to make things a bit more robust fall back to using a newer
    # configuration than the one missing. As we don't have a timestamp
    # for the configuration, a safe bet is to use the current configuration.
    # Caveat: the current workflow definition might not be compatible with
    # the particular workflow instance. There is a risk that the workflow
    # instance gets stuck in an unreachable state.
    # In comparison to not being able to even view the workflow this seems
    # to be an acceptable tradeoff.
